# 👋 Hey there, I’m **Sanath Lal** — your friendly neighborhood developer!

Welcome to my GitHub profile — where code mostly works, bugs occasionally win, and commits magically appear at suspicious hours of the night. If you're here for productivity… well, you're lost. If you're here for chaos with a sprinkle of talent — welcome home. 😎

## 🚀 About Me

* 🎮 **Game Developer**: I make games. Sometimes they even run. On good days, they run without crashing.
* 🥽 **AR/VR Developer**: I build realities inside realities because the real world doesn’t have enough cool buttons.
* 💻 **Frontend Developer**: I make pixels behave. They don’t listen.
* 🧑‍💼 **Leader-ish**: I don’t *take* leadership roles; they chase me like a side quest I didn't accept.
* ⚙️ **Professional Fixer of Things I Broke**: Step 1: Build. Step 2: Break. Step 3: Fix. Step 4: Act like it was part of the plan.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### **Languages I speak (besides sarcasm):**

* Java, Python, C++, C, Blueprints, HTML, CSS (and mild panic during debugging)

### **Technologies I vibe with:**

* 🕶️ **AR/VR**: Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender (where half my life goes)
* 🛠️ **Tools**: Git (my toxic relationship), VS Code, Notion (my brain’s external hard drive), Figma

```
[🚧 Under construction]
If stats aren't visible, just assume I'm incredibly productive. Like… *legendary level* productive.

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

* Collaborate with cool developers — yes, you, dear reader.

## 😄 Fun Facts

* I debug using print statements like I'm interrogating a criminal.
* I still believe semicolons have personal vendettas.
* My Git commit messages range from "fixed thing" to "WHY DOES NOTHING WORK??"
* I willingly take tasks meant for others… then cry but finish them anyway.

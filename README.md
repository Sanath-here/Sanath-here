# 😎 Sanath Lal — The Developer Who Fixes Things He Didn't Break

Welcome to my GitHub profile — where ideas spawn faster than I can finish them, caffeine is an API, and every commit is either a masterpiece… or a cry for help.

# 🧑‍🚀 Who Am I?

A multi-classed developer with maxed-out curiosity and zero points in "taking a break".

* 🎮 **Game Developer** — I make worlds where physics *sometimes* listens to me.
* 🥽 **AR/VR Developer** — I bring impossible things into reality, then lose them somewhere in the scene hierarchy.
* 💻 **Frontend Developer** — I negotiate with CSS daily. CSS always wins.
* 🎮 **Gamer** — I lose games but win in spirit.
* 🧑‍💼 **Leadership DNA** — I take tasks no one wants… and actually complete them (with mild emotional damage).
* 🔧 **Certified Chaos Engineer** — If it works the first time, I get suspicious.

* **Tools:** Git (my love-hate story), VS Code, Notion, Figma, kaggle, blahh.....blah....blahhh....

### 🎮 Skills I Pretend Are Normal:

* Taking responsibility for things I didn’t do
* Solving problems with solutions I forgot to document
